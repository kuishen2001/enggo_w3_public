How to use the website? It has the following features:
- The home page shows the name of the knowledge base - Chem CaFe, the list of most recent few posts (with images if available), the about/contact/helpful_links, the copyright items.
- The left sidebar has Archive (all posts), Category (eg., Sol = solutions, to be expandable), Tags (useful for classifications), and RSS Feed (showing all posts succinctly), which are pointing to useful sites.
- The individual post has images embeded if available, with prev next and other links, and TOC on the top right side.
